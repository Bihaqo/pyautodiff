PyAutoDiff
==========

Automatic differentiation for NumPy (very new, experimental, unreliable, etc... but *promising*)


Dependencies:
  * Theano [official master](https://github.com/Theano/Theano.git) or [jaberg master](https://github.com/jaberg/Theano.git) (*no official release will work*)


Thanks:
  * Travis Oliphant for posting a very early version of [numba](https://github.com/ContinuumIO/numba) which provided the inspiration and starting point for this project.
